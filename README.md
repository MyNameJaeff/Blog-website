# Blog-Hemsidan
This was a task during my 3rd year at NTI Södertörn. It was about creating a blog webite

## Requirements
The requirements for this project was to make a blog website where a user could login/register and if they did they would gain the ability to create a blog-post that had a title, description, text and an image

## Extra function
Because i had some time over from making the required functions of the website so i chose to use that time to add a few extra functions instead of styling the website.
One of the added functions was the ability to view another users page and see all of the blogs that user had posted.
Another of the added functions was the ability to seach a blog by text input, i only managed to make it work by searching by exact title.
