# Blog-website
This was a task during my 3rd year at NTI Södertörn. It was about creating a blog webite

## Requirements
The requirements for this project was to make a blog website where a user could login/register and if they did they would gain the ability to create a blog-post that had a title, description, text and an image. If the user registered/blogged the data was to be sent to a SQL databse, while the image was to be uploaded to the computer due to SQL not having image storing. Instead the image was to be converted to a relative link. 

## Extra function
Because i had some time over from making the required functions of the website so i chose to use that time to add a few extra functions instead of styling the website.
One of the added functions was the ability to view another users page and see all of the blogs that user had posted.
Another of the added functions was the ability to seach a blog by text input, i only managed to make it work by searching by exact title.
